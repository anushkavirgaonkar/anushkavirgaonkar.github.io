Can you tell whether one smell is just twice strong as another? Can you measure the difference between two kinds of smell and another? It is very obvious that we have very many different kinds of smells, all the way from the odour of violets and roses up to asafetida. But until you can measure their likeness and differences, you can have no science of odour. If you are ambitious to find a new science, measure a smell.” An electric nose is a device which has the capability of detecting, identifying and discriminating the presence of molecules in a sample of air. It was termed by Gardner and Barlett in 1994. The improvements over the past 20 years have led to the creation of the artificial olfaction technology.\nElectronic noses are based on the mammalian olfactory model. The olfactory receptors that are responsible for detection of odorants in the human body are analogous to the array of electronic sensors in the electronic nose. Biomimetics is a field in which the principles of biology, chemistry and engineering are applied to develop an artificial system that is based on a natural phenomenon. Electronic nose is one example of it.\nThe electronic nose comprises of three components- a detecting system, computing system and sample delivery system. The delivery system collects the required sample, which is then sent to the detection system. The detection system is a group of sensors, which change their electrical characteristics on coming in contact with the volatile compounds. Scientists were successful in creating a global fingerprint for every unique smell and flavor. The computing system has an Artificial Neural Network. This ANN is trained with qualified samples taken from a reference database. The instrument then recognizes new samples by comparing them with the existing fingerprints from the database. With the help of this architecture, the electronic nose simulates the mammalian olfactory system.This has however proven to be inaccurate in some cases of odors, where it may be made up of multiple different molecules. The electronic nose interprets these different molecules as different compounds, thereby posing inaccurate results.\nCurrent research aims to increase the accuracy, reliability and efficiency of the electric nose. With the emergence of this out-of-the-world technology, applications are endless. Detecting contamination, spoilage or adulteration of materials is a major use case. Electronic noses have been used for quality control applications in food, beverage, cosmetic and perfumery industries. They are used to identify volatile organic compounds in air,water and soil samples for conducting agricultural analysis. Currently, they are being developed for conducting medical diagnosis, where the patient’s breath is analysed to detect the presence of certain chemicals responsible for a disease. A person’s breath contains 2,500 chemical compounds. If a person is ill, his breath, when analysed can indicate the kind of disease he has. Tuberculosis is proven to be detected in this manner. Furthermore, research is being carried out to use this technique for detecting volatile organic compounds emitted by different types of cancerous cells. NASA has developed its own e-nose model that is able to sniff out cancerous Brain cells. Thus, electronic nose facilitates in detecting cancer in a non-invasive, rapid and reliable manner.\nThe scope of this technology has just scratched the surface. In a few years, this technology may even get embedded in smart phones. The Google Nose prank that the company played on us on April Fools’ day, might turn into reality. Who knows what technology has for us in the future; someday, people would be able to smell things just by searching them on Google!\n","date":1563102001,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563102001,"objectID":"ff6c6adda18dd28c3d03fc3cbe70b632","permalink":"https://anushkavirgaonkar.dev/post/what-is-an-electronic-nose/","publishdate":"2019-07-14T11:00:01Z","relpermalink":"/post/what-is-an-electronic-nose/","section":"post","summary":"Alexander Graham Bell once said- “Did you ever measure a smell?

Python code can be translated to a runnable binary with the .pyc file. The Python interpreter converts the .py file to a runnable binary in order to prevent recompilation of the code and save time in future. If the same python script is called again, the interpreter simply exectutes the precompiled .pyc file to save time.\nchaitanya@meetups$ python3 -m py_compile foo.py  GetPass Function Ever created a Python script that accepts passwords as input? The normal input() function in Python shows on the screen what you are typing. The GetPass function allows you to get passwords as input the UNIX style.\nfrom getpass import getpass username = input(\u0026quot;Enter your username: \u0026quot;) password = getpass(\u0026quot;Enter your password: \u0026quot;) print(username,password,sep = '\\n')  HTTP Server Want to host your files or a static website? Python has a built in minimalistic HTTP Server useful for serving static content. It is fast and easy to use.\nanushka@meetups$ python3 -m http.server 8001  Hiding Secrets \u0026amp; Keys with Enviroment variables Exposing your private keys or passwords in Python scripts is not a good idea, especially if you are uploading the code on some online repository. Secrets and keys should be stored in environment variables, which then Python can access through the  os  module.\nOn a Linux/Mac machine -\nchaitanya@meetups$ nano .bash_profile  Add a line to the .bash_profile file -\nexport password=\u0026quot;mypassword\u0026quot;  import os print(os.environ.get(\u0026quot;password\u0026quot;))  Underscore placeholders There are five underscore variable naming conventions used in Python  Single Leading Underscore: _var Single Trailing Underscore: var_ Double Leading Underscore: __var Double Leading and Trailing Underscore: _var_ Single Underscore: _\n_x = 10 # 1.

Acts as a sort-of private variable (Name-mangling) class Base(object): def __init__(self): # Constructor self.__foo = 7 class Derived(Base): def __init__(self): super().__init__() # Calling the base class constructor self.__foo = 10 s = Derived() print(\u0026quot;Value from derived class: \u0026quot;,s._Derived__foo) print(\u0026quot;Value from base class: \u0026quot;,s._Base__foo) # 4. __var__ is reserved for internal Python magic methods and variables. Not recommended to be used by programmer. # 5. Single underscore acts as useless variables by convention. It is also used as a temporary variable in Python REPL for _ in range(2): # Code None   Secrets Module Python has a module to generate secure random numbers. It uses the operating system\u0026rsquo;s random number generator.\nimport secrets token = secrets.token_hex(16) print(token)   # Why the random module in Python is insecure r1 = random.Random(31337) outputs = [r1.getrandbits(32) for _ in range(625)] mtr = MT19937Recover() # Mersenne Twister Breaker r2 = mtr.go(outputs) print(r1.getrandbits(32) == r2.getrandbits(32))  Shallow and Deep Copy In Python, assignment statements do not copy objects, they create bindings between a target and an object. When we use = operator user thinks that this creates a new object; well, it doesn’t. It only creates a new variable that shares the reference of the original object.\n# Shallow copy l = [1,2,3,4,5] p = l l[0] = 100 print(p[0])  100  # Deep copy import copy l = [1,2,3,4,5] p = copy.deepcopy(l) # Creates a deep copy q = list(l) # Creates a deep copy l[0] = 100 print(p[0]) print(q[0])  1 1  a = [0 for i in range(5)] mat = list() for _ in range(5): mat.append(a) # Creates a shallow copy mat[1][1] = 10 print(mat)  Default Dictionary Python allows us to preset dictionary values even if a given key does not exist in the dictionary. This can be done with defaultdict from collections module.\nimport collections data = { 'Tom':33, 'Jack':45, 'Jill':32, 'Mark':45, 'Sam':38 } # Lengthy way if 'John' in data: print(data['John']) else: print('Absent') # Recommended way print(data.get('John','Absent')) # Recommended way marks_data = collections.defaultdict(int) print(marks_data['Tom']) pass_data = collections.defaultdict(str) print(pass_data['Tom']) students_data = collections.defaultdict(lambda:'Absent') students_data.update(data) print(students_data['Jim'])  Type Hinting Type hinting is a Python programming convention that allows us to specify the return type \u0026amp; parameters of the function. This is a good coding practice that improves code readability.\ndef headline_without_type(text, align=True): if align: return f\u0026quot;{text.title()}\\n{'-' * len(text)}\u0026quot; else: return f\u0026quot; {text.title()} \u0026quot;.center(50, \u0026quot;o\u0026quot;) def headline_with_type(text: str, align: bool = True) -\u0026gt; str: if align: return f\u0026quot;{text.title()}\\n{'-' * len(text)}\u0026quot; else: return f\u0026quot; {text.title()} \u0026quot;.center(50, \u0026quot;o\u0026quot;) print(headline_without_type(\u0026quot;python type checking\u0026quot;)) print(headline_with_type(\u0026quot;python type checking\u0026quot;, False))  == vs is There are two ways in Python to check the equivalence of two variables. However there is a big difference between their compiler level implementation.\nlist1 = [1,2,3] list2 = list1 list3 = list(list1) print(list1 == list2) print(list1 == list3) print(list1 is list2) print(list1 is list3)  True True True False  Extended Iterable Unpacking Extended iterable unpacking allows us to use star operator to gather items from an iterable as a list.\na,b,c = [1,2,3] print(a,b,c) cities = ['London','Paris','New York','Boston','Jerusalem','California'] start,*route,end = cities print(start) print(route) print(end)  1 2 3 London ['Paris', 'New York', 'Boston', 'Jerusalem'] California  Antigravity Python is not that boring!
