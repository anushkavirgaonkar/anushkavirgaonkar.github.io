      <title>Centralized or Decentralized? The Contact Tracing Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://anushkavirgaonkar.dev/talk/centralized-vs-decentralized/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a summary of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/531.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Centralized or Decentralized? The Contact Tracing Dilemma&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; research paper having the following abstract - &amp;ldquo;The COVID-19 pandemic created a noticeable challenge to the cryptographic community with the development of contact tracing applications. The media reported a dispute between designers proposing a centralized or a decentralized solution (namely, the PEPP-PT and the DP3T projects).
Perhaps, the time constraints to develop and deploy efficient solutions led to non-optimal (in terms
of privacy) solutions. Moreover, arguments have been severely biased and the scientific debate did
not really happen until recently. In this paper, we show the vulnerabilities and the advantages of
both solutions systematically. We believe that none offers any sufficient level of privacy protection
and the decision to use one or another is as hard as using automated contact tracing at the first
place. A third way could be explored. We list here a few possible directions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Summarizing and Analyzing the Privacy-Preserving Techniques in Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies</title>
      <link>https://anushkavirgaonkar.dev/talk/privacy-blockchain/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin and many other similar Cryptocurrencies have been in existence for over a decade, prominently focusing on decentralized, pseudo-anonymous ledger-based transactions. Many protocol improvements and changes have resulted in new variants of Cryptocurrencies that are known for their peculiar characteristics. For instance, Storjcoin is a Proof-of-Storage-based Cryptocurrency that incentivizes its peers based on the amount of storage owned by them. Cryptocurrencies like Monero strive for user privacy by using privacy-centric cryptographic algorithms.  While Cryptocurrencies strive to maintain peer transparency by making the transactions and the entire ledger public, user privacy is compromised at times. Monero and many other privacy-centric Cryptocurrencies have significantly improved from the original Bitcoin protocol after several problems were found in the protocol. Most of these deficiencies were related to the privacy of users. Even though Bitcoin claims to have pseudo-anonymous user identities, many attacks have managed to successfully de-anonymize users. In this paper, we present some well-known attacks and analysis techniques that have compromised the privacy of Bitcoin and many other similar Cryptocurrencies. We also analyze and study different privacy-preserving algorithms and the problems these algorithms manage to solve. Lastly, we touch upon the ethics, impact, legality, and acceptance of imposing these privacy algorithms.

      <title>Designing a Secure Device-to-Device File Transfer Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://anushkavirgaonkar.dev/talk/secure-p2p-file-transfer/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://anushkavirgaonkar.dev/talk/secure-p2p-file-transfer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Secure, reliable, and fast transfer of files across the Internet is a problem attempted to be solved through many application-layer protocols. In this paper, we aim to design a secure, reliable, open-design, and performant file transfer protocol that is inspired by the WebRTC protocol stack. Traditionally, transferring files involves a publicly exposed (available on the public network) third-party server that serves the uploaded files to the receiver. Here, the third-party server has to bear the storage and bandwidth cost to transfer the files between the two parties. We propose a protocol that uses a relay server to relay the files from the client to the server. A relay server has several advantages over a regular file-hosting server. Firstly, a relay server does not retain the uploaded files, it simply relays them. Secondly, a relay server has a full-duplex communication channel and therefore the receiver is not required to wait for the sender to upload the files completely. In this paper, we study available file transfer approaches and their known flaws. We propose our idea and compare our stack with WebRTC. Finally, we perform empirical analysis and, benchmark our device-to-device transfer approach along with other available options including WebRTC.

      <title>Hidden Secrets of Python</title>
      <link>https://anushkavirgaonkar.dev/talk/python-pune-sept/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Python has a large number of really cool modules that people don&amp;rsquo;t know about. These are quite helpful. People often tend to program the hard way since they don&amp;rsquo;t know about the existence of these modules. Such examples can be the itertools module, the secrets module to generate secure random numbers etc. Get a copy of the talk slides &lt;a href=&#34;https://bit.ly/python-meetups-sept&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
