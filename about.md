<p align="center">I am a software engineer who has an interest in the fields of cyber security, computer networking, operating systems and database management systems. Being a cyber security enthusiast, I have introduced and organized a cyber security and ethical hacking event 'Lakshya', in PICT InC'19. It has developed my leadership, public speaking and management skills. I love to explore the field of computer science and aspire to contribute towards it.</p>
